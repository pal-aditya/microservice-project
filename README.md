# Microservice‑Project

A microservices-based web application built with Python Flask, demonstrating a clean separation of concerns across authentication, gameplay, and frontend delivery using Kubernetes and statically served content.

---

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

This project is composed of **three microservices**, each implemented using **Python Flask**, and containerized for Kubernetes deployment:

### 1. `authservice`
- Provides **user authentication** (Sign Up and Login).
- Exposes REST APIs for session and credential handling.

### 2. `gameservice`
- Handles all **game logic and state**, including Snake Game mechanics and score management.

### 3. `frontend`
- Uses **Nginx** to statically serve the web interfaces, including:
  - The login page
  - The game UI
- Acts as a reverse proxy to `authservice` and `gameservice`.

---

## 🗄️ Database Layer

- Uses **CloudNativePG** (PostgreSQL operator) to manage the database:
  - Automatic **cluster creation**
  - High availability with **replication**
  - **Persistent storage** enabled by default

### 🔄 Backup Strategy

- Integrated with **Barman** using Kubernetes manifests
- Provides automated backup and restore workflows via:
  - A separate **backup cluster**
  - `Backup` manifest objects for periodic or manual snapshots

## ⚙️ Kubernetes Manifests Explained

This project contains Kubernetes manifests to configure various system components:

| Manifest File         | Purpose |
|------------------------|---------|
| `cluster-issuer.yaml` | Defines a **ClusterIssuer** resource to generate HTTPS TLS certificates using **Let's Encrypt** for custom domains specified in your ingress/gateway hostnames. |
| `configmap.yaml`      | Stores **PostgreSQL initialization SQL scripts** (like `init.sql`) used to bootstrap the database (e.g., create tables or seed data). |
| `httpredirect.yaml`   | Configures **HTTP (port 80) redirection to HTTPS (port 443)** for the application's domain. Ensures secure access by default. |
| `httproute.yaml`      | Defines routing rules that forward traffic from path `/` to the **frontend service**, effectively serving the UI. |
| `gateway.yaml`        | Sets up an **API Gateway using Kubernetes Gateway API**. It listens on both ports **80 (HTTP)** and **443 (HTTPS)**, configures the TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt, and routes traffic to appropriate services. |

---

## 🔧 Shell Scripts

The repository also includes `.sh` scripts used to help during development and debugging:

| Script File | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `*.sh`      | Custom shell scripts used to **generate logs** or **tail logs** from individual services (e.g., authservice, gameservice). Helpful for debugging runtime issues and monitoring service health. |

---

## 🌐 Service Discovery

All services are exposed internally in Kubernetes and can be reached using **FQDNs** resolved by **CoreDNS**:

```http
http://<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
