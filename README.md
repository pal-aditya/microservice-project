# Microservice‑Project

A microservices-based project developed by *pal‑aditya*, intended to demonstrate how multiple independent services can communicate and function in a distributed architecture.

##  Project Structure

- **Microservices architecture** — Each component is designed as a standalone service (e.g. user-service, auth-service, etc.), allowing independent development and deployment.
- **Inter-service communication** via HTTP APIs or messaging middleware (depending on implementation).
- **Support for modern infrastructure** — The architecture is likely intended for containerization using Docker, and possibly orchestration using Kubernetes (typical for Spring Cloud or similar stacks).

##  Screenshots

Visual previews from the project:

- **Snake Game Interface** – A grid-based snake game, displaying a “Game Over” screen with a score of 0 and a restart option.
- **Login Portal UI** – A branded login form titled “NextGen Info Solution”, including inputs for username and password, and a sign-up link.

##  Features

| Feature                        | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| Microservice Architecture     | Independent services allow modular design and scalability. |
| Scalability & Resilience      | Services can be scaled individually and fail in isolation. |
| Clean Front-end Interfaces    | Game UI and login templates are simple, clean, and user-friendly. |

*(Adapt based on actual services and UI components.)*
